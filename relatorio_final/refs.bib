    abstract={This essay expounds on Raphael Cohen-Almagor's recent book, Confronting the Internet's Dark Side, Moral and Social Responsibility on the Free Highway, and advocates placing narrow limitations on hate speech posted to social media websites. The Internet is a limitless platform for information and data sharing. It is, in addition, however, a low-cost, high-speed dissemination mechanism that facilitates the spreading of hate speech including violent and virtual threats. Indictment and prosecution for social media posts that transgress from opinion to inciteful hate speech are appropriate in limited circumstances. This article uses various real-world examples to explore when limitations on Internet-based hate speech are appropriate. In October 2015, twenty thousand Israelis joined a civil lawsuit filed against Facebook in the Supreme Court for the State of New York. Led by the civil rights organization, Shurat HaDin, the suit alleges Facebook allows Palestinian extremists to openly recruit and train terrorists to plan violent attacks calling for the murder of Israeli Jews through their Facebook pages. The suit raises important questions, amongst them: When should the government initiate similar suits to impose criminal sanctions for targeted hate speech posted to Facebook? What constitute effective restrictions on social media that also balance society's need for robust dialogue and free communication, subject to limitations reflecting a need for order and respect among people? Our essay progresses in four stages. First, we examine philosophical origins of free speech and the historical foundations of free speech in the United States. Second, we provide an overview of American free speech jurisprudence. Third, we address particular jurisprudence that provides a framework for imposing limitations on free speech in the context of social media. American history and jurisprudence embrace free speech as a grounding principle of democracy, yet simultaneously subject speech to limitations. Finally, through a comparative exploration of real-world examples, we address the narrow instance when limitations on inciteful and targeted hate speech are appropriate.},

    abstract={For machine learning, the quality of the data, as well as its pre-processing, since the
algorithms used mainly derive knowledge from these same data, is decisive for the quality
of the results. The presence or absence of unknown values and the selection of key data,
so as not to contaminate the database used with information unrelated to the objective,
for example, are decisive factors when it comes to the cited merit. In many applications it
is important to think about how to proceed with available information if it is incomplete
as the handling of unknown values must be carefully planned or the risk of misstatement
arises. This work presents a panoramic view of the subject as well as the implementation of
pre-processing techniques applied to a database that contains Covid 19 data, demonstrating
the processes followed and the results acquired, and showing how the pre-processing of
data can influence the final result of implementing an algorithm. Learning to work with
unbalanced data is essential, because in the various fields in which they are found, it is
difficult to find a perfectly balanced base, therefore, understanding how to perform a good
pre-processing is a possible solution to improve the results of projects with learning from
machine.

abstract={Clinicians and software developers need to understand how proposed machine learning (ML) models could improve patient care. No single metric captures all the desirable properties of a model, which is why several metrics are typically reported to summarize a model's performance. Unfortunately, these measures are not easily understandable by many clinicians. Moreover, comparison of models across studies in an objective manner is challenging, and no tool exists to compare models using the same performance metrics. This paper looks at previous ML studies done in gastroenterology, provides an explanation of what different metrics mean in the context of binary classification in the presented studies, and gives a thorough explanation of how different metrics should be interpreted. We also release an open source web-based tool that may be used to aid in calculating the most relevant metrics presented in this paper so that other researchers and clinicians may easily incorporate them into their research.},

    abstract ={We introduce the Measuring Hate Speech corpus, a dataset created to measure hate speech while adjusting for annotators{'} perspectives. It consists of 50,070 social media comments spanning YouTube, Reddit, and Twitter, labeled by 11,143 annotators recruited from Amazon Mechanical Turk. Each observation includes 10 ordinal labels: sentiment, disrespect, insult, attacking/defending, humiliation, inferior/superior status, dehumanization, violence, genocide, and a 3-valued hate speech benchmark label. The labels are aggregated using faceted Rasch measurement theory (RMT) into a continuous score that measures each comment{'}s location on a hate speech spectrum. The annotation experimental design assigned comments to multiple annotators in order to yield a linked network, allowing annotator disagreement (perspective) to be statistically summarized. Annotators{'} labeling strictness was estimated during the RMT scaling, projecting their perspective onto a linear measure that was adjusted for the hate speech score. Models that incorporate this annotator perspective parameter as an auxiliary input can generate label- and score-level predictions conditional on annotator perspective. The corpus includes the identity group targets of each comment (8 groups, 42 subgroups) and annotator demographics (6 groups, 40 subgroups), facilitating analyses of interactions between annotator- and comment-level identities, i.e. identity-related annotator perspective.},

    abstract={Motor Imagery Electroencephalogram (MI-EEG) signals are widely used in Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI). MI-EEG signals of large limbs movements have been explored in recent researches because they deliver relevant classification rates for BCI systems. However, smaller and noisy signals corresponding to hand-finger imagined movements are less frequently used because they are difficult to classify. This study proposes a method for decoding finger imagined movements of the right hand. For this purpose, MI-EEG signals from C3, Cz, P3, and Pz sensors were carefully selected to be processed in the proposed framework. Therefore, a method based on Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) is used to tackle the problem of noisy signals. At the same time, the sequence classification is performed by a stacked Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) network. The proposed method was evaluated using k-fold cross-validation on a public dataset, obtaining an accuracy of 82.26%.
